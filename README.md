# Bounty Bonus

Bounty Bonus is the final project for UC Berekely Extension Web Design Bootcamp. 

You can see it deployed here: https://bountybonus.herokuapp.com/

## Getting Started

Once you have logged into the system, you may create bounties for other users to complete. This is done by providing the information on the bounty on the Create Bounty Page.

You may also instead focus on just claiming available bounties and completing them. To claim a bounty, just go to the Bounties page and click the Claim button,

### Installing

1. Clone to a local directory and run npm install in both the frontend and backend folders
2. run npm start in backend, then after it is launched run it in the frontend.

Base system is running at this point, and any bounty data can be entered.

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com//) - The web framework used
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - User Authentication
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Basically everything
